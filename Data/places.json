        "description": "Coxs Bazar, town, southeastern Bangladesh. It is situated along the Bay of Bengal about 60 miles (100 km) south of Chittagong. The town, constituted a municipality in 1869, was named for Hiram Cox, who supervised the settlement there of Arakanese refugees from conquest by Myanmar (Burma) in 1799. Ramu, 10 miles (16 km) to the east, is the site of a historic Buddhist temple. With a long unbroken beach and a small port, Coxs Bazar is a popular tourist resort, connected by road, rail, and air with Chittagong. Major industries in addition to tourism include fish processing, salt production, ice making, printing, and the milling of rice, flour, and wood. Garment production and weaving, woodworking, and metalworking are prominent cottage industries",

        "description": "It is said the name Sreemangal (or Srimangal) is named after Sri Das and Mangal Das; two brothers who settled on the banks of the Hail Haor. A copper plate of Raja Marundanath from the 11th century was found in Kalapur. During an excavation at Lamua, an ancient statue of Ananta Narayan was dug out. In 1454, the Nirmai Shiva Bari was built and still stands today. Srimangal thana was established in 1912. The central town later became a pourashava in 1935. In 1963, two peasants were killed by police officers which kicked off the Balishira peasant riots.",

        "description": "The Sundarbans mangrove forest, one of the largest such forests in the world (140,000 ha), lies on the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers on the Bay of Bengal. It is adjacent to the border of Indiaâ€™s Sundarbans World Heritage site inscribed in 1987. The site is intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests, and presents an excellent example of ongoing ecological processes. The area is known for its wide range of fauna, including 260 bird species, the Bengal tiger and other threatened species such as the estuarine crocodile and the Indian python.",
